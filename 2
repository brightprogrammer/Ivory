## Comments
- Project is using CMake build system.
- On a unix based system with `cmake` already installed perform the following steps :
  - Create a directory named `Build`
  - Open the `Build` dir in terminal.
  - Type `cmake ..` and hit enter.
  - Type `make -j4` and hit enter.
  - Type `bin/Ivory` and hit enter to launch the program.
  - You can also go to the directory and run the program directly if that's possible.
- To spawn random items, click on the container (not on the item boxes or items themselves!)
