# The assignment specifies 3 rarity levels, but to spice things up, I'll specify more levels of rarity
#
# I used ChatGPT to generate more rarity levels based on the ones given
#    Common: Basic items that are readily available and not particularly valuable.
#    Uncommon: Slightly rarer than common items, these may have minor bonuses or enhancements.
#    Rare: Items with significant enhancements or unique properties, but still relatively attainable.
#    Very Rare: Items that are quite uncommon and possess powerful or valuable properties.
#    Legendary: Highly sought-after and extremely powerful items with game-changing abilities.
#    Mythical: Items of legendary status, often with a rich lore and immense power.
#    Divine: Items of divine origin or significance, with unparalleled abilities.
#    Artifact: Incredibly rare and ancient items with world-altering powers.
#    Relic: Items of immense historical and mystical importance, often tied to the game's lore.
#    Transcendent: The rarest of all items, with abilities beyond mortal comprehension, capable of reshaping the game world.
#
# I also extended the type of items from 4 to 5 to include almost all icons in the pack
#    Food
#    Weapon
#    Armor
#    Craft
#    Collectible (extra, added by me)
